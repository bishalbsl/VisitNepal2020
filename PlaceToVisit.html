 				<h3>Mount Everest </h3>
				<img src="images/ptov/everest.jpg" width="1000px" height="300px" >
				<p>Mount Everest is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. 
				The international border between Nepal and China runs across its summit point.
				Everest Base Camp is the most desirable and reachable place for tourists to take a panoramic view of Mount Everest – the highest peak in the world.
				Besides, it acts as Mt. Everest mountaineering headquarters
				Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains, and mountain climbing is a key source of employment and income for the poor nation. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, some of them highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and other from the north in Tibet. 

				<h3>Ilam</h3>
				<img src="images/ptov/kanyam.jpg" width="1000px" height="300px" >
				<p>An excellent getaway from city life, Ilam is famous for its tea. 
				It is a district largely covered in tea bushes with a hill town right beside a plantation enjoying views of pristine landscapes made up of sloping tea gardens,
				 mountain streams, dense natural forests, holy sites and a unique culture. Using Ilam Bazaar as a base you can take excursions for a day or more. 
				There are many hotels in the town and a few resorts a short distance away in the tea gardens.While the subtropical climate of Ilam ensures good weather most of the year,
				 except during the monsoon when heavy rains engulf most of Nepal, the best time to visit is between October to December or from February to April.

	 			<h3>Pathivara temple</h3>
	 			 <img src="images/ptov/pathivhara.jpg" width="1000px" height="300px">
	 			<p>Pathibhara Devi Temple. Pathibhara Devi (Nepali: पाथिभरा देवी मन्दिर) or
				 Mukkumlung (as mentioned in Mundhum of Limbu people) is one of the most significant temples in Nepal,
				 located on the hill of Taplejung. ... The temple is located 19.4 North East from Phungling municipality at an elevation of 3,794 m (12,444.32 ft).
				 Pathibhara temple is reached by a steep climb, anywhere from 3 to 5 hours depending on your fitness. The old path has now been replaced by stairs.
				 There are several villages where you can get refreshments during the first half of the climb.
				 At the last village you can get overnight accommodations if you wish to do the final stage early in the morning. 
				 You can also hire a car in Taplejung to take you over a rough and bumpy 4WD road to the foot of the mountain.
 
			
 				<h3>Pokhara </h3>
				<img src="images/ptov/pokhara.jpg" width="1000px" height="300px" >
				<p>Pokhara is an ideal destination for all kinds of tourists belonging to all age groups. 
				 From hills to lakes and from markets to shrines; tourist places to visit in Pokhara are in surplus despite the
				 small geographical area occupied by the city. Whether you are daredevil who wishes to get closer to the highest  
				 of the peaks by indulging in trekking or you are someone who wants to stay in the soothing embrace of nature by 
				 sailing a boat on the tranquil waters of a lake, Pokhara is the place to be. 
				 Whenever you plan to tour Nepal, make sure to add a couple of extra days to spend Pokhara.

				<h3>Lumbini</h3>
				<img src="images/ptov/lumbini.jpg" width="1000px" height="300px" >
				<p>Nestled in the Himalayas near the Indian border, the beautiful town of Lumbini is the birthplace of Lord Buddha.
				 A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Lumbini has a plethora of ancient stupas dating back to 2000 years and monasteries 
				 that were built by the past dynasties. People come here from all over the world to this abode of Buddhism to study 
				 scriptures, meditate, practise yoga, trek, learn more about Buddhism and find inner peace. Buddhism, founded in North India, is not a religion in the strict sense but more a system of philosophy and a code of morality. Buddhism is now practised in all the major countries of the world but predominantly in Japan, Taiwan, China, Sri Lanka, Indo-Chinese countries, India, and Nepal.

				<h3>Chitwan National Park.</h3>

	 			<h3>Kathmandu</h3>
	 			 <img src="images/ptov/ktm.jpeg" width="1000px" height="300px">
				<p>Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, is set in a valley surrounded by the Himalayan mountains. 
				 At the heart of the old city’s mazelike alleys is Durbar Square, which becomes frenetic during Indra Jatra,
				 a religious festival featuring masked dances. Many of the city's historic sites were damaged or destroyed by a 2015 earthquake.
				 Durbar Square's palace, Hanuman Dhoka, and Kasthamandap, a wooden Hindu temple, are being rebuilt.Pashupatinath Temple,Boudhanath Stupa,Swayambhu Temple and thamel
				 are the mostly visited and beautiful places to  visit in kathmandu. Kathmandu’s two main streets contrast strongly to the older sectors of narrow streets and brick houses adorned with carved doors and windows.

				<h3>Mount API</h3>
				<img src="images/ptov/api.jpg" width="1000px" height="300px" >
				<p>Api is the highest peak in the Yoka Pahar Section of Gurans Himal, part of the Himalayas in the extreme northwest corner of Nepal,
				 near the borders of India and Tibet. It is a little-known peak in a rarely visited part of the Himalayas, but it rises dramatically 
				 over the low surrounding terrain. Although low in elevation among the major mountains of Nepal, Api is exceptional in its rise above 
				 local terrain; the surrounding valleys are significantly lower than those surrounding most higher Himalayan peaks.
				Api Himal Expedition starts after you trek up to the Api Himal Base Camp at an altitude of (4,000m.). It takes about 20 days for you 
				to attempt the summit during which you take days rest and construct different camps at different height for acclimatizing you.
